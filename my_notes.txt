Tried to download the action2motion data via: 
bash prepare/download_a2m_datasets.sh

This is only regarding the UESTC dataset. 
The HUmanAct12 dataset was successfully downloaded so I will use that for now. 

For now I downloaded the pretrained model humanact12. 
The is also a version called humanact12_no_fc. Maybe this is usefull if I 
want to continue the learning on the karate dataset. 
The models internal layers might have learned some general properties about 
motion that could be used as a starting point for training. 


Note: 125 at 25 fps means max 5 seconds. Longer motions will be cut.

# Data representation version: 
1) direction vector of movement between two joints, distance statically stored. This vector is converted to 6d rotation.
Problem: Reasons to assume instability, due to the vector being scalable but having the same direction (normalized during reconstruction). One part of the loss would be sentive to scale while other parts will not. This reasoning might be false if this does not apply to 6d vectors. I think they do not have continuity issues. 
2) Axis angle between the two joints, distance statically stored. Magnitude of vector is the angle and vector the rotation axis.  
Problem: Second point can not be uniquely caluclated since the sine rule has cases where there are two solutions. Also angel from dot product is not signed. Therefore potentially 4 solutions. 
3) Shifted coordinate system so that first point is at (0,0,0). Still axis angles and stored distance. Signed angle. No need for sign rule. One solution.
