Tried to download the action2motion data via: 
bash prepare/download_a2m_datasets.sh

Result:

This is only regarding the UESTC dataset. 
The HUmanAct12 dataset was successfully downloaded so I will use that for now. 

For now I downloaded the pretrained model humanact12. 
The is also a version called humanact12_no_fc. Maybe this is usefull if I 
want to continue the learning on the karate dataset. 
The models internal layers might have learned some general properties about 
motion that could be used as a starting point for training. 


Note: 125 at 25 fps means max 5 seconds. Longer motions will be cut.
