The are the joint centers. There are only 12 so instead 
the markers will be used. 
'LHJC', 'RHJC', 'LKJC', 'RKJC', 'LAJC', 'RAJC', 
'LSJC', 'RSJC', 'LEJC', 'REJC', 'LWJC', 'RWJC'

TODO: for text, calculate average dispersion in mm
between original posirtions and calculates ones, 
to show that the assumption is justified. 



Closer look at the techniques: 

0: 'Gyaku-Zuki',   # reverse punch
- on individualk occasions 3 punches instead of 2. This happened very rarely so it is not represented well in the dataset. Nevertheless it will be interesting to see if the final model is capable of transforming a 3-punch sequence into a two punch sequence when increasing the skill level. The other way around also interesting but will likely not be the case due to the rarity of this event

1: 'Mae-Geri',   # front kick


2: 'Mawashi-Geri gedan',   # roundhouse kick at knee to hip height


3: 'Mawashi-Geri jodan',   # roundhouse kick at shoulder to (top) head height


4: 'Ushiro-Mawashi-Geri'   # spinning back kick
- on some occasions participants switch there feet right before the technique because they had the wrong dominant foot in the front. Interesting to see what the skill level modifcation would do . Maybe the switched foot is a simpler version of the technique because it allows to gain more momentum but is more obvious to the opponent (do some research on this).
- soetimes participants turn back around in the opposite direction of the spinning motion after touching the opstacle. I believe (do more research) that the corect technique is to follow through with the kick. Interesting to see what modifiaction of skill level will do 
- due to the difficulaty of the technique many beginners stutter at the start and/or have a less fluid motion than the advanced athletes. Also interesting to see if modification learns this
